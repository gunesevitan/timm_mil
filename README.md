## What is Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)?

Multiple Instance Learning is a type of weakly supervised learning algorithm
where training data is arranged in bags,
where each bag contains a set of instances and one single label.

MIL is most commonly used on very large whole slide images,
but it can be applied to any kind of large images that can't be processed by itself.
